    <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
   
</center>
<p class="a"> 
    The current growth in distance education is a result of a convergence of
    factors. The delivery technology has become more affordable, available,
    familiar and interactive. With improvements in the technology, distance
    courses are now more realistic, engaging, inexpensive, and varied. The
    audience of learners is more experienced and capable with the technology,
    due to the increased availability of distance education, and they welcome
    distance learning into their busy lives. Technology-mediated distance educa
   tion research has matured enough to produce an extensive body of evidence
    that distance education can be at least as effective as classroom instruction.<br>
  &nbsp;  &nbsp;The exciting convergence that brought about the growth in distance
        education also presented distance learners with a challenge: how to choose the
        best distance learning opportunities from the vast catalog of options. Distance
        learners can easily compare the costs, technical needs, cognitive require
       ments, and time demands of distance learning courses. Learners are less well
        equipped to distinguish high quality courses from the offerings. Distance
        education programs have the responsibility of communicating to students the
        quality assurance measures they employ, whether the measures consist of in
       house practices or accreditation by outside bodies.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter describes trends that have led to the growth of distance
        education from elementary school through higher education and professional
        development. The following sections present critical success factors that
        institutions, course developers, instructors, and students have found through
        practice to lead to high quality distance education experiences. These guide
       lines are presented as they inform the three stages of the distance education
        development cycle: resources, practices, and results. In addition, two distance
        education programs are described as case illustrations that exemplify the
        successful application of success factors.</p><br><br>
        <center><b class="t"> TRENDS CONTRIBUTING TO THE GROWTH<br>
            OF DISTANCE EDUCATION</b></center>
            <p class="a"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Distance education, as experienced via the Internet, is a result of the
                convergence of several recent trends. Access to the Internet is now available
                in some form to most Americans, and distance education is increasingly seen
                as a practical and effective pathway to learning. A growing concern among
                distance learners is determining the level of quality of distance education
                programs. This section examines the trends leading to the growth of distance
                education and the need for distance education quality assurance.</p><br>
                <p class="a"><b class="h"> Interest in Distance Education</b><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;   Interest in distance learning is on the rise among high school students,
 college students and professionals. A recent survey found that the major
ity of parents polled obtained Internet access for their children’s education
 (Grunwald Associates, 2000), and as of the year 2000, a full 15% of U.S.
 high schools offered access to online classes (Market Data Retrieval,
 2000). By the year 2002, over 2 million distance learning students are
 expected in higher education (Web-Based Education Commission, 2000).
 In a survey of working adults the majority stated that they believe college
 courses offered via the Internet are the future of higher education, with
 32% expressing a preference for online courses over classroom learning,
 given equal quality of education (CyberAtlas, 2000). A survey of business
 managers who have used Internet-based training found that nearly 100%
 of respondents would recommend it, mainly because of “anytime, any
where” access (CyberAtlas, 2000). While the expense of developing high
quality distance education materials can be high, return on investment
 analyses are beginning to show that training efficiency and resulting
 productivity gains make distance education worthwhile.
                </p>
                <p class="a"><b class="h">Effectiveness of Distance Education</b><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;  Traditional reviews of distance education literature conducted in the
                    1980s indicated that adult learners achieve as well in distance education
                    programs as they do in classroom settings (Moore, 1989). A quantitative
                    review of the achievement of over 900 students in K-12 distance education
                    programs found no significant differences in student achievement between
                    distance learners and classroom learners (Cavanaugh, 1999). Other studies
                    described by Moore and Thompson (1990) indicate that the instructional
                    format itself has little effect on student achievement as long as the delivery
                    technology is appropriate for the content and timely teacher-to-student
                    feedback is included. Good distance teaching practices have been found to be
                    fundamentally identical to good classroom teaching practices, with quality
                    factors being universal across environments and populations (Wilkes &
                    Burnham, 1991).</p>
                    <p class="a"> <b class="h">Assurance of Quality in Distance Education</b><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;  With obstacles such as access and convenience largely overcome,
                        students and workers are embracing distance education as a solution to the
                        educational problems of course variety, time flexibility, and transportation
                        limitations. As consumers of distance learning become more experienced and
                        as distance education offerings become more varied, demand for high quality
                        in distance education grows. Distance education providers vary widely in the
                        methods they use to establish quality criteria, ensure that they meet the
                        criteria, and communicate their quality assurance procedures to students.
                        Instructors have concerns regarding the identity and honesty of the students
                        doing the work in distance education courses. Administrators at many
                        traditional institutions fear that public perception about the meaning of a
                        college degree will erode if distance learning courses are added to the
                        curriculum (Office of Educational Research and Improvement, 2000). In
                        response, online and traditional institutions of higher education have imple
                       mented standards for accreditation. This chapter offers an examination of
                        success factors for quality distance education, with exemplary cases included
                        to illustrate best practices.</p>
                        <p class="a"> <b class="h">Defining Quality</b><br>
                     &nbsp;       &nbsp; In its December 2000 report to Congress, the Web-Based Education
                            Commission made high-quality online educational content one of its seven
                            critical issues. In order for a student or institution to determine whether quality
                            has been achieved, quality must be defined. A primary goal of educators is
                           
                            developing independent learners who can capably apply their knowledge to
                            new situations. To ensure that distance education offerings meet this goal,
                            providers must identify desired learning outcomes and instructional methods.
                            Quality indicates that instruction is effective and appropriate. The definition
                            of quality may include quantitative elements such as completion rates, student
                            performance, and student evaluations of the learning experience. Qualitative
                            dimensions may include ratings of teaching-learning events, materials, learn
                           ing process, pace, activities, content and options offered to students. Effective
                            and appropriate outcomes and methods for distance education are adopted
                            from educational practice, business systems, and learning research. The
                            following sections apply specific approaches from education, business and
                            research to achieve quality distance education experiences.</p>
                            <p class="a"><b class="b q">THE QUALITY DISTANCE EDUCATION CYCLE</b><br>
                         &nbsp;    &nbsp;   The process of developing and implementing effective distance educa
                               tion happens in an iterative cycle. Broadly considered, the three stages in the
                                cycle are (1) procurement and preparation of the resources necessary to meet
                                the distance education goals, (2) delivery of instruction using the best
                                practices from education, business and research, and (3) analysis of the results
                                of distance education to gauge achievement of the goals. Each stage of the
                                Resources-Practices-Results (RPR) cycle continually revisits lessons learned
                                in the other stages and builds upon the successes realized in the other stages.
                                Each stage requires participation of all stakeholders, including students,
                                instructors, support and design professionals, administrators, and the com
                               munity. The critical success factors discussed in each stage are based on
                                decades of research and experience with learners from professions, higher
                                education and K-12 education (Barker, 1999; Bruce, Fallon & Horton, 2000;

                         &nbsp;&nbsp;           The resources required to sustain a quality distance education program
                                    exist to support students, faculty, and the program or institution toward
                                    achieving the goal of effective and appropriate learning. Responsive and
                                    flexible human resources, knowledge, skills, policies, procedures and techni

                                    and ongoing commitment of resources has resulted in a high-quality distance
                                    education program.</p>
                                    <p class="a"><i> Institutional and Program Resources</i><br>
                                      &nbsp; &nbsp; To provide a vigorous quality distance education program, an institution
                                        begins with policy that values distance education as an endeavor that inte
                                       grates seamlessly with the institution’s mission and goals. With such a policy
                                        in place, understood by administration and staff, the institution is positioned
                                        to create a strategic plan for delivering distance education to students. In
                                        planning, distance education administrators and instructors engage in con
                                       tinuous dialogue with a broad range of stakeholders in specifying quality
                                        benchmarks (Vaughan, 2000). Providers forge consensus with past, present
                                        and potential future students about the perceived effectiveness of courses, and
                                        they communicate with employers to determine the match between the skills
                                        and knowledge required on the job and those developed in the course
                                        (Kearsley, 2000).<br>
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;The strategic plan is a financial and philosophical commitment that gives
                                        the direction to personnel who make specific decisions regarding program
                                        implementation. It is a commitment to team support for distance educators
                                        and students, technology led by the program’s current and future goals, and
                                        development of program standards. Course developers and instructors need
                                        target standards to guide course design and delivery. As a partner to the
                                        standards, program review procedures must be developed, implemented, and
                                        revised frequently to ensure that all components of the program meet
                                        standards and to ensure that the standards contribute to program goals. For
                                        example, academic accrediting bodies may limit the amount or type of
                                      
                                        learning that may occur via distance education, or faculty may decide that
                                        certain courses such as laboratory courses are inappropriate for distance
                                        education. Standards and results of reviews are used to drive future decision
                                       making, including selection of qualified experienced instructors and levels of
                                        support needed throughout the program.<br>
                                     &nbsp;&nbsp;   Administration of a quality distance education program depends on clear
                                        and accurate communication to students. Students need access to information
                                        about admission, tuition, materials, technical requirements, learning expec
                                       tations and support available to them. For students to be successful, the
                                        program must advise entering students, including screening for students who
                                        display success indicators for the program, and consideration of prior learning
                                        experiences. Registered students need orientation and counseling so they will
                                        be properly placed in the program. Students need assurance that their rights
                                        are protected and their records will be confidentially maintained as well as
                                        available to other institutions. Student privacy and security in online activities
                                        must also be ensured.<br>
                                  &nbsp;    &nbsp;   All education programs are built essentially on their people. For facility
                                       free distance education programs, this fact is critical, making human re
                                       sources a vital responsibility of the institution. Qualified instructors and
                                        support staff must be recruited, they must be provided with development
                                        opportunities related to instruction, content knowledge and technical skill,
                                        and they must receive feedback on their teaching. Because students often
                                        learn to fulfill a career goal, the program benefits when employers and other
                                        community members understand, support and contribute to the program’s
                                        goals, policies, and outcomes.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;    Community members, who may be thought of as consumers of the
                                        program’s products, are valuable sources for program evaluation data. Quali
                                       tative input about student performance, satisfaction, and success is at least as
                                        important as quantitative data such as enrollment, costs, utilization of
                                        technology, and hiring rates. The elements of the comprehensive program
                                        evaluation process should be communicated to all stakeholders in advance,
                                        and the results should be reported completely and efficiently.

                                        have the desired attitudes and understanding of the distance education
                                        teaching and learning process. For faculty members to succeed in distance
                                        education, they need to be supported with accurate and complete information
                                        and training in order to develop their skills and understanding. Successful
                                        distance educators understand the distance learning environment and the
                                      
                                        options that exist for instruction. They recognize the time and effort necessary
                                        for producing and teaching an effective course, and are provided with release
                                        time in advance for course preparation. They have experience using the tools
                                        of distance education, and receive opportunities to learn and practice with
                                        new tools. Ideally, instructors are involved in the evaluation and selection of
                                        technology resources and in the development of policy for their programs. In
                                        addition to their distance education competencies, faculty in high-quality
                                        programs excel in their academic field, have earned credentials in the
                                        profession, and contribute to scholarship in their subject.<br>
                                     &nbsp;&nbsp;   In support of the design and delivery of quality courses, institutions are
                                        responsible for providing training and resources for instructors. All distance
                                        education faculty members require training aligned with their needs in
                                        pedagogical and technical skills, including distance learning course organi
                                       zation, planning, teaching and assessment strategies. This training is most
                                        effective when it is followed up with ongoing course design assistance and
                                        peer mentoring throughout course delivery. The training should cover pacing
                                        and sequencing of activities, broadcast or online communication skills, and
                                        methods of interaction with students that develop critical thinking and
                                        problem-solving skills.<br>
                                  &nbsp;     &nbsp; Instructors need continual access to the physical resources and human
                                        support that will enable development of high-quality teaching materials.
                                        Materials used by students must be appropriate for the content area, using the
                                        media and delivery technology that suits the content. Most distance learning
                                        courses are highly visual, but many arts, communication, science and other
                                        courses depend on high-quality audio and motion capabilities. Materials
                                        should be presented in an organized, functional and easily navigated struc
                                       ture. The materials used in successful distance learning courses are comfort
                                       able and affordable for students to use, accessible to all learners, in accordance
                                        with copyright restrictions, and free of errors and bias. The materials result in
                                        quality learning when they are interesting and attractive, varied to support
                                        different learning styles, and used in meaningful work. The best distance
                                        learning courses use complete and up-to-date materials to increase the
                                        information literacy of students, while allowing opportunities for creative
                                        expression and mastery of concepts.</p>
                                        <p class="a"><i>Student Support Resources</i><br>
                                   &nbsp;   &nbsp;      The focus of distance education is the students, whose work is made
                                          better when they receive well-designed instruction in a well-planned pro
                                         gram. For students to maximize the time and effort they spend on their
                                          learning, they must minimize the time and effort they spend on solving
                                        
                                          nonacademic problems and seeking answers. Many questions are answered
                                          in comprehensive orientation opportunities that cover “the what” and “the
                                          how” of distance learning, the processes of the institution, and the require
                                         ments of the program. Orientation is accomplished with synchronous online
                                          or face-to-face sessions and with asynchronous print or web-based guides.
                                          Some students need hands-on technical training using the tools employed in
                                          courses and in using general learning tools such as libraries and information
                                          archives. Information literacy training should include guidance in the legal
                                          and ethical uses of electronic information. As students begin the work of
                                          learning, they need continual access to instructors, libraries and other student
                                          resources. They also need a streamlined technical support system accessible
                                          through several channels, such as toll-free phone, fax, email, web, and help
                                          desk.<br>
                                     &nbsp;  &nbsp;   As an example, the Southern Regional Electronic Campus (SREB), a
                                          distance learning clearinghouse for higher education institutions, publishes a
                                          guide called Principles of Good Practice (2000). Institutions following the
                                          principles assure students of the quality of the courses listed and endorsed by
                                          the SREB. The principles require an online course or program to provide
                                          students with “clear, complete and timely information” on requirements,
                                          interaction, prerequisite skills, equipment requirements, support services,
                                          financial resources, and costs. Students must have adequate access to re
                                         sources appropriate to support their learning. The institution must assess the
                                          student’s ability to succeed in online learning.</p>
                                          <p class="a"><i> Technical Resources</i><br>
                                     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Even given the best plan, program, instructors, materials and students,
                                            distance learning does not occur without the technology for delivery. Tech
                                           nology selection decisions involve all stakeholders. A technology plan guides
                                            decision-makers in considering student outcomes, program goals, and tech
                                           nical feasibility. Technology selection must consider tools used by profes
                                           sionals, the skills and budget of students, and the institution’s ability to
                                            provide support. The technology and infrastructure contribute to quality
                                            learning when they are reliable, secure and fully supported. Support extends
                                            to all users of the technology for all facets of the learning process. Users
                                            require assistance with hardware and software uses. Students require assis
                                           tance with access of electronic resources. Instructors require assistance with
                                            lesson development and delivery, including editing, graphic design, research,
                                            and communication with students.<br>
                                       &nbsp; &nbsp;    The eight education accrediting commissions acted together in 2000 to
                                            draft the Guidelines for the Evaluation of Electronically Offered Degree and
                                           
                                            Certification Programs (Council of Regional Accrediting Commissions). In
                                            the area of technical resources, the guidelines specify that institutions must
                                            “strive to assure a consistent and coherent technical framework for students
                                            and faculty.” The technology must be selected based on appropriateness for
                                            students and curriculum, reasonable cost for students, maximum reliability,
                                            and a plan to keep the technology updated. In support of the technical
                                            framework, institutions must provide technical support for each hardware,
                                            software and delivery system required in a program. Support mechanisms
                                            recommended in the guidelines were a help desk with person-to-person
                                            contact and a well-designed FAQ.</p>
                                            <p class="a"><i>Exemplary Case: University of Central Florida</i><br>
                                            &nbsp;   &nbsp; In the days before electronic distance education, the University of Central
                                                Florida was called Florida Technological University. While the university’s
                                                focus has expanded, it has not lost touch with its technological roots. In 2000,
                                                UCF received the United States Distance Learning Association’s award for
                                                Excellence in Distance Learning Programming for Higher Education. The
                                                award and the success of the university’s distance education programs are a
                                                direct result of an institutional commitment of significant resources to
                                                distance education. Located in Orlando, Florida, the university serves a large
                                                geographic area in the state’s high-tech corridor. The university’s strategic
                                                plan embraces distance education as a way to facilitate the learning of a
                                                growing clientele. Beginning with senior administrators, UCF’s organiza-
                                               tional structure supports its “Virtual Campus.” The Center for Distributed
                                                Learning and the Course Development and Web Services Department both
                                                fall under the auspices of two Vice-Provosts.<br>
                                             &nbsp;&nbsp;   The university’s budget reflects the importance of distance learning
                                                programs in meeting institutional goals. The university funds the technical
                                                infrastructure, faculty development, learner support, research and develop
                                               ment in distance learning, and impact evaluation. The technical infrastructure
                                                consists of wired and wireless network connections to every building, access
                                                to Internet2, dedicated servers for online courses, and always-on access to
                                                information and services for all students and staff. Faculty development
                                                services are especially noteworthy. All distance teaching faculty take a faculty
                                                development course, for which they receive a stipend or a laptop computer.
                                                Faculty members are given release time and stipends for course development
                                                and are assisted in all phases of course design and delivery by trained Tech
                                                Rangers. Course instructors are required to file an RFP for a planned distance
                                                learning course to ensure that it meets the needs of programs and students. A
                                                university evaluation unit collects data on courses and students for use in
                                                future planning.<br>
                                           &nbsp; &nbsp;    To support learners, UCF enables students to apply for admission and
 register for courses online. Course schedules, technical guides, distance
 education orientation courses, financial aid information, library access, and
 textbook purchasing are all accomplished on the Web. Technical support is
 always available by phone or Web, and a group of CyberKnights acts as
 student computer consultants (so named for the university’s mascot, the
 knight). A CD-ROM contains Internet software, a browser test, tutorials, and
 automatic configuration for network dial-up access. The university’s research
 and development projects investigate technical solutions for distance educa
tion and they study the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching
 distance courses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Impact evaluation at UCF concentrates on student and faculty issues
 related to successful distance education. Student issues include success rates,
 withdrawal rates, learning styles, attitudes and demographics. Faculty issues
 include instructional tools, data warehousing, action research, and program
 accreditation. For more details, see UCF’s Virtual Campus website at http:/
